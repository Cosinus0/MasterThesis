Monday Night:
Calculate response time for the refractive indexs
Table values from different model techqiues
vapour refractive index for toulene -> look at liquid -> less than that maybe
Try and make graphs bigger:
	Thicker red lines

Tuesday:
Spin coating - ask sina
Light source flucuations experiment again
Discussion:
	Light source:
		Is it continuous or abrupt?
	polystyrene vs. polyisoprene:
		refractive index upper bound 1.5
		intergration time vs. timescale
		homogenous increase in descrete thickness vs. continuous increase in descrete thickness
		Gap between data and fit
		spikes in thickness isoprene vs no spikes in polystyrene
		when fixing average n?
	homopolymers vs. linear
		Linear makes non sense
		Linear AB model different from homopolymer model
		More parameters to fit.

Wednesday:
Reading through the report:
	More differentiation between what i do and what nanocalc does	


Future:
Reflectance = How does it look?	
Parameter Contour plot
