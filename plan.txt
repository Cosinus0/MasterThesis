Discussion:
	Light source:
		Is it continuous or abrupt?
	Polystyrene vs. polyisoprene:
		refractive index upper bound 1.5
		intergration time vs. timescale
		spikes in thickness isoprene vs no spikes in polystyrene
		when fixing average n?

Which results seem resonable? -> Model assumption

Wednesday:
Reading through the report:
	More differentiation between what i do and what nanocalc does	
Spin coating - ask sina
Light source flucuations experiment again


Fill in:
Table values from different model techqiues
Calculate response time for the refractive indexs


Saturday/Sunday:
Reflectance = How does it look?	
Parameter Contour plot
