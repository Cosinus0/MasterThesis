Discussion:
	Light source:
		Is it continuous or abrupt?

Wednesday:	
Spin coating - ask sina
Light source flucuations experiment again


Fill in:
Table values from different model techqiues
Calculate response time for the refractive indexs


Saturday/Sunday:
Reflectance = How does it look?	
Parameter Contour plot
	
Polystyrene vs. polyisoprene:
	when fixing average n?
	refractive index upper bound 1.5
