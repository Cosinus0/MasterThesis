Tuesday:
Spin coating - ask sina
Light source flucuations experiment again

Discussion:
	Light source:
		Is it continuous or abrupt?
	Ambient study:
		Does n=1.3 make sense?
	SVA:
		Constant vapour pressure - Done
		SVA protocol off -Done
	Polystyrene vs. polyisoprene:
		refractive index upper bound 1.5
		intergration time vs. timescale
		homogenous increase in descrete thickness vs. continuous increase in descrete thickness
		Gap between data and fit - DONE
		spikes in thickness isoprene vs no spikes in polystyrene
		when fixing average n?
	Linear:
		Linear makes not sense - DONE
		Linear AB model different from homopolymer model -DONE
		More parameters to fit. - Done

Which results seem resonable? -> Model assumption

Wednesday:
Reading through the report:
	More differentiation between what i do and what nanocalc does	


Fill in:
Table values from different model techqiues
Calculate response time for the refractive indexs
vapour refractive index for toulene -> look at liquid -> less than that maybe



Saturday/Sunday:
Reflectance = How does it look?	
Parameter Contour plot
