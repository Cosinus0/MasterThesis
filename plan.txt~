	More differentiation between what i do and what nanocalc does	
Spin coating - ask sina
Light source flucuations experiment again


Fill in:
Table values from different model techqiues
Calculate response time for the refractive indexs


Saturday/Sunday:
Reflectance = How does it look?	
Parameter Contour plot
	
	Polystyrene vs. polyisoprene:
		when fixing average n?
		refractive index upper bound 1.5
