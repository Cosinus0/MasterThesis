AmbientInvestigation

Wafer:topsil blank wafer
Swelling protocol started at 14:03 -- Run 12

Number of Measurements: 1076

Scripts:

MSE_ambient.m - Loops through refractive index values and the mean square error. The refractive index value is save which corresponds to the least mean square.

reflectancemovie.m - Writes a swelling movie showing the reflectance measurements and the refractive index for the ambient.

reflectanceplotsambient.m - Plucks out some reflectance measurements during the swelling and deswelling and plots them.

refractiveplotsambient.m - Plots the refractive index and the mean square error as a function of time.s
